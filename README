DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  get_rss_from_twitter_search(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    In June 2013, Twitter retired the RSS v1 API (e.g.
    http://search.twitter.com/search.rss?q=blah). However, its replacement,
    the v1.1 API, is not as straightforward to use (e.g. needs auth). This
    function scrapes the Twitter search result page (e.g.
    https://twitter.com/search?q=blah) and converts it to RSS. I wrote this
    because I have other scripts expecting RSS input.

    Expect breakage from time to time though, as scraping method is rather
    fragile.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   query* => *str*

        Search query.

    *   ua => *obj*

        Supply a custom LWP::UserAgent object.

        If supplied, will be used instead of the default LWP::UserAgent
        object.

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array). First element (status) is an
    integer containing HTTP status code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx
    function error). Second element (msg) is a string containing error
    message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third element (result) is optional,
    the actual result. Fourth element (meta) is called result metadata and
    is optional, a hash that contains extra information.
